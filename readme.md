# üöÄ OKX Sell on Listing Bot

This Python script automatically places a limit sell order immediately after a new token is listed on OKX, at a configurable price below the market. It's built for speed, precision, and safety during high-volatility listing events.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Features

  * **Async/await** ‚Äî Built using asynchronous programming for maximum responsiveness with the OKX API.
  * **Time synchronization** ‚Äî Syncs with OKX server time before starting the countdown to avoid clock drift.
  * **Configurable Pre-Launch Pooling** ‚Äî Begins checking for the trading pair a specified number of seconds (`pre_launch_pooling`) before your exact `launch_time`.
  * **Continuous Monitoring** ‚Äî Polls the OKX REST API for the appearance of the trading pair at a defined `pair_check_interval`.
  * **Smart Price and Quantity Calculation** ‚Äî Applies OKX's instrument rules (`tickSz` for price and `lotSz` for quantity) to ensure your order meets exchange requirements and avoids errors.
  * **Infinite Price Retrieval Retries** ‚Äî Continuously attempts to fetch the current price until successful or program interruption, with a configurable `price_check_interval` between attempts.
  * **Automatic Order Cancellation** ‚Äî If the order isn't filled within a configurable `order_timeout`, it is automatically cancelled.
  * **API Key Pre-Checks** ‚Äî Verifies the validity of your API key, secret, and passphrase using a lightweight balance check before starting the main bot logic.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2.  **Create a `config.py` file in the root directory:**

    ```python
    # OKX API Credentials
    api_key = 'YOUR_OKX_API_KEY'
    api_secret = 'YOUR_OKX_SECRET_KEY'
    passphrase = 'YOUR_OKX_PASSPHRASE'

    # Trading configuration
    pair = 'ALT/USDT'                       # Trading pair, e.g.: 'ALT/USDT'
    tokens_for_sale = '100'                 # Amount of tokens to sell
    price_offset = '1.0'                    # Percentage below market price (e.g., '1.0' means 1% below)

    # Timing configuration
    launch_time = '2025-05-29 12:00:00'     # Exact trading start time (UTC) in 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' format
    pre_launch_pooling = 10                 # How many seconds before launch_time to start checking for the pair listing
    pair_check_interval = 0.5               # Interval (in seconds) between trade pair availability checks
    price_check_interval = 1.0              # Interval (in seconds) between price retrieval attempts upon error
    order_timeout = 30                      # Cancel order after this many seconds if not filled
    ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: API Key Permissions

Make sure your OKX API key has **"Trade"** permission enabled.

If you encounter an `"Invalid Sign"` error (code: `50113`), it is highly likely that your `api_key`, `api_secret`, or `passphrase` are incorrect. Double-check them carefully. Also, ensure any IP restrictions for the API key match your server's IP address.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

Simply rename the script file to `main.py` and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

## üõ† Notes

  * The `passphrase` is not your login password. It is a specific password you create for the API key on the OKX website.
  * The time format for `launch_time` must be `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"` in UTC.
  * If you launch the bot after `launch_time` has passed, it will immediately begin checking for the pair.
  * The script uses modern Python `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for robust operation.
  * Order details are displayed in a readable table format using `tabulate`.
